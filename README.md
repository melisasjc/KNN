# KNN

This repo considers the file of KNN which consists of formula and code to predict the weight using KNN algorithm without the
usage of any packages.

## About KNN
The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, easy-to-implement supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems. The KNN algorithm assumes that similar things exist in close proximity. In other words, similar things are near to each other.
